# Health Connect

Feel free to use it as a base for your upcoming Health project or just do a clone if you are curious

**I have synced my google Fit data to Health Connect.**


If you are wondering how to do that you can see a sync with Health Connect toggle button in the settings screen of google Fit app you can turn it on and give all the necessary permissions
